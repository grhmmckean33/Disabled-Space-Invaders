A new take on the old classic game Space Invaders, only this war is about people parking in disabled parking bays that do not have permission to do so.
Basically, it's Space Invaders for pissed off disabled drivers!<br><br>

# Project Description
This is much like the classic Space invaders where an army of aliens slowly creep down the screen firing at you the player, as you try to shoot all the aliens down before they shoot you and stop them reaching you at the bottom of the screen. Here though the aliens are represented by walking humans. This represents those in society that think they have some sort of right to park in a disabled bay, but they are not disabled in any way whatsoever. This represents those in society that think they have some sort of right to park in a disabled bay, when they do not own or are even entitled to have blue disabled parking badge. This represents those in society that think they have some sort of right to park in a disabled bay, just because they can fake it by limping away from their car and then when they are far enough away and are in the safety of the store, they are miraculously cured and walk normally<br><br>
The player, the disabled person in a wheelchair in this case, is the hero character and you have to control them by using keys to move left, right and to fire lasers at the advancing walking human aliens. In the classic space invaders there were also shields or barriers the player could hide behind for protection which were slowly destroyed by the aliens leaving no cover for the player. In this incarnation the shields or barriers are depicted by blue disabled parking permits and they too are slowly destroyed by the encroaching human aliens. <br><br>

# Background
I remember when Space Invaders first hit big and I played it with my friends at school on an old BBC Micro. So imagine my pleasure back when I was first learning Python a few years back when from one of my many books on the subject, I came across a tutorial which showed me how to create a version of space invaders.  This was just what I needed, getting to learn Python whilst creating one of my old favourite games. It was a no brainer making learning to code more fun. However, it was quite a basic version and only had the aliens shooting back at my spaceship. There was none of the following showing on screen: <br><br>
•	scoreboard<br>
•	hi-score<br>
•	levels <br>
•	lives<br>
•	not even a barrier or shield<br>
•	no button to press to play again or quit the game<br><br>
Armed with the above objectives to improve it and learn to code even better, I scoured the internet for solutions, which included forums originally and even ChatGPT more recently. <br><br>
But whilst I was working it all out I wanted to do something different with the concept but ideas I had, had already been done and tried. It was then I was on a shopping trip to my local supermarket, I had just parked up in the disabled bay, put my disabled badges up on display and was in the process of getting my wheelchair ready to lift from the passenger seat and over myself and steering wheel to get it out of the driver side as usual. Just as I looked up though I noticed a car parked opposite without a disabled parking badge and before I could do anything else, the owner of the car walked casually back with a full trolley, unloaded it into his boot. He then walked without any issues to return the trolley. When he came back got in the car without any obvious disability and drove off. This annoyed me, because yet again another person had parked in the disabled bays without needing to or having any disabled parking badge to do so. I carried on and went to get my shopping. When I came back I noticed more cars in disabled bays that did not have a blue disabled badge showing. By this time I was furious, because I had lost count at the number of times I have had to circle the car park, which incidentally had plenty of non-disabled parking free, yet I had to be the one inconvenienced on my lunch break! <br><br>
It was then it hit me. Disabled Parking Invaders. Now it was payback time! The rest as they say is history and the game was born. <br><br>
This is one for all those pissed off disabled drivers out there! <br><br>
# Technologies Used
Python Packages:
1.	pygame
2.	sys
3.	random
Other Software:
1.	CoPilot AI Image Generator
2.	ChatGPT
# Requirements
Python 3.11

# Usage Instructions
1.	Download all the contents files for Disabled_Space_Invaders into a folder on your local machine.
2.	From within your chosen Python code compiler (ie. VisualStudio or PyCharm), open and run the dpi_v1.py file.
3.	The program will automatically load, follow the on screen prompt and the game will start.
4.	Use the following keys: <br>
•	‘A’, (move left) <br>
•	‘D’, (move right)<br> 
•	‘Spacebar’, (fire laser)<br>
5.	Once you have run out of lives and it is game over, you will be prompted to replay again by clicking with the mouse on the screen, or you can press ‘Q’ to quit the game. If you play again then the highest score you had achieved in that session will stay on the screen, so you have something to beat.
