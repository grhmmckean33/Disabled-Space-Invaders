# Disabled_Space_Invaders
A new take on the old classic game Space Invaders, only this war is about people parking in disabled parking bays that do not have permission to do so.
Basically, it's Space Invaders for frustrated disabled drivers!<br><br>

# Project Description (refer to screenshot below)
This is much like the classic Space invaders where an army of aliens slowly creep down the screen firing at you the player, as you try to shoot all the aliens down before they shoot you and stop them reaching you at the bottom of the screen. Here though the aliens are represented by walking humans. This represents those in society that think they have some sort of right to park in a disabled bay, but they are not disabled in any way whatsoever. Furthermore they do not possess a disabled parking badge either, so they do not have any right to park in disabled parking, thus depriving somoene with a wheelchair or other mobility aid that has a disabed parking permit from b eiing able to park in a bay that has enough space for them to get in and out of their car.
<br><br>
The player spaceship, is represented by the disabled person in a wheelchair in this case. This is the hero character and you have to control them by using keyboard or the joypad to move left, right and to fire lasers at the advancing walking human aliens.
<br><br>
In the classic space invaders there were also shields or barriers the player could hide behind for protection which were slowly destroyed by the aliens leaving no cover for the player. In this incarnation the shields or barriers are depicted by blue disabled parking permits and they too are slowly destroyed by the encroaching human aliens. <br><br>

# Background
I was first learning Python a few years back when from one of my many books on the subject, I came across a tutorial which showed me how to create a version of space invaders.  This was just what I needed, learning Python whilst creating one of the old classic games. It was a no brainer which made learning to code more fun. However, it was quite a basic version and only had the aliens shooting back at my spaceship. There was none of the following showing on screen: <br><br>
•	scoreboard<br>
•	hi-score<br>
•	levels <br>
•	lives<br>
•	not even a barrier or shield<br>
•	no button to press to play again or quit the game<br>
•	and definitely no Joypad or alternative controller option to play instead of keyboard
<br><br>
Armed with the above objectives to improve it and learn to code even better, I scoured the internet for solutions, which included forums originally and even ChatGPT more recently. 
<br><br>
But whilst I was working it all out I wanted to do something different with the concept but ideas I had, had already been done and tried. It was then I was on a shopping trip to my local supermarket, I had just parked up in the disabled bay, put my disabled badges up on display and was in the process of getting my wheelchair ready to haul over from the passenger seat, steering and out of the driver side. Noticing someone park up in a disabled bay without displaying a blue badge and he just got out and walked without problems, it was then it suddenly hit me.
<strong>Disabled Space Invaders.</strong>
<br><br>
The rest as they say is history and the game was born. 
<br><br>
This is one for all those frustrated disabled drivers out there, like me!

# Technologies Used
Python Packages:
1.	pygame
2.	sys
3.	random
   <br><br>
Other Software:
1.	CoPilot AI Image Generator
2.	ChatGPT
   
# Requirements
Python 3.11

# Game Controls
Keyboard:<br>
1. 'Spacebar' - to Shoot
2. 'A' - move player Left
3. 'S' - move player Right
4. Mouseclick on screen - starts the game
5. 'Q' - to Quit or End the game
<br><br>
Joypad (Logitech Wingman):<br>
1. Axis button - move player Left and Right
2. Joystick - move player Left and Right
3. Right Fire button - to Shoot
4. 'A' - starts the game
5. 'Z' - to Quit or End the game
<br><br>
Touchscreen Controls (mobile app):<br>
Yet to be developed.
<br><br>

For desktop/laptop version both keybard or joypad can be used. Although currently only setup for my Logitech Wingman joypad, it can be setup to function with any joypad/joystick controller. 
<br><br>

With regards to a touchscreen controls for a mobile app, this I will be developing separately from the desktop version, and I will also be converting it for use as an app that will feature in the Google Play store and Apple Play store.<br><br>

# Usage Instructions
1.	Download all the contents files for Disabled_Space_Invaders into a folder on your local machine.
2.	From within your chosen Python code compiler (ie. VisualStudio or PyCharm), open and run the dpi_v1.py file.
3.	The program will automatically load, follow the on screen prompt and the game will start.
4.	Use the following keys: <br>
•	‘A’, (move left) <br>
•	‘D’, (move right)<br> 
•	‘Spacebar’, (fire laser)<br>
5.	Once you have run out of lives and it is game over, you will be prompted to replay again by clicking with the mouse on the screen, or you can press ‘Q’ to quit the game. If you play again then the highest score you had achieved in that session will stay on the screen, so you have something to beat.
